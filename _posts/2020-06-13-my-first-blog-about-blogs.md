I thought hard about what my website will look like, and what I'd post. 

The truth is - I can never think it through. I keep changing my thoughts, and the more I think about it, the more anxious I feel.

I was caught in the loop of thinking-but-not-doing.

I had to act. 

Act first, feelings will follow.

Therefore, here I am.
